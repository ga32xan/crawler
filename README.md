This is a file crawler to look into directories and search for files :
	created within a special time period:

Messzeiten:
	Within this files you can define the days start and end for file gathering (%Y-%m-%d-%H:%M) 
	as well as a description that will be used to create a new folder in destination. The note column will be copied into note-file in the destination folder.

By default it looks into  /home/ga32xan/Network/LT_Testdata/ and writes files to 
home/ga32xan/Network/private/Promotion/Daten/"description"

have Fun! :D
